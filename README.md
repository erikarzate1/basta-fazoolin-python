## Basta Fazoolin'

A Python terminal application that models a restaurant business. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts including classes, inheritance, and data structures.
Project Overview
Basta Fazoolin' is a restaurant management system that simulates the operations of an Italian restaurant chain. The application allows for:

Creating and managing menus with time-based availability
Setting up restaurant franchises with specific hours of operation
Managing business expansion through different restaurant brands
Implementing core business logic for a food service establishment

## Tech and Concepts Used: 

Python 3
Object-Oriented Programming
Data Structures (Lists, Dictionaries)

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I've demonstrated the ability to:

Design and implement class hierarchies
Use inheritance and composition to model real-world relationships
Create objects with appropriate attributes and methods
Implement business logic through code
Manage complex data relationships

## How to Run

Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system
Clone this repository
Navigate to the project directory
Run the application using:
Copypython basta_fazoolin.py


## Project Structure

basta_fazoolin.py: Main Python file containing all the classes and application logic
Classes include:

Menu: Handles menu items and their availability windows
Franchise: Manages restaurant locations and their associated menus
Business: Models the overall restaurant business structure



## About This Project
This project was completed as part of Codecademy's Python 3 course. It represents my first GitHub repository and showcases my ability to implement practical business concepts using Python programming.

## Future Improvements

Add a text and graphical user interface(GUI)
Implement a database for persistent storage
